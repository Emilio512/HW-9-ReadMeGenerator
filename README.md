## Description
This is a simple and easy application to generate a professional readme markdown file.
# Purpose
I built this project because starting anything from scratch is time consuming.
# Resolution
This solved a time issue. So when a user uses this application, they can continue on future projects efficently. 
# Outcome
I leaner a lot of different things such as node.js and how to use a switch case. They are both not very easy to understand!
